# YourWallet

YourWallet is a modern fintech platform for instant, borderless person-to-person and business-to-business payments. The concept blends traditional banking rails with blockchain interoperability, enabling users to seamlessly move value between fiat accounts, debit cards, and crypto wallets while enjoying strong security and compliance controls.

## Key Pillars

- **Frictionless onboarding** – Sign up with email and ID verification, no credit checks or waiting periods.
- **Instant transfers** – Send and receive payments between consumers or businesses using ACH, cards, crypto deposits, or peer-to-peer transfers.
- **Open cash-in and cash-out** – Load and off-ramp funds via bank accounts, debit/credit cards, or supported crypto networks.
- **Multiple payment methods** – Empower users with a Visa-branded card, virtual wallet balances, and crypto withdrawals.
- **Security-first** – Advanced encryption, risk monitoring, fraud detection, and regulatory compliance to safeguard funds and data.
