## Application Layers

1. **Client Applications**
   - Native iOS (SwiftUI) and Android (Kotlin) apps for biometric login, push notifications, and offline caching.
   - Responsive web app (React + TypeScript) for desktop users, business dashboards, and developer portal.
   - Shared component library for consistent design and accessibility.

2. **API Gateway & BFF**
   - GraphQL or REST gateway (Apollo Gateway / Kong) routing to microservices.
   - Backend-for-frontend (BFF) services tailor responses for mobile, web, and business clients.
   - OAuth2/OIDC for session management with short-lived access tokens.

3. **Microservices**
   - **Identity Service**: Handles registration, login, MFA, credential storage (using Cognito/Auth0 or custom with Keycloak).
   - **User Profile Service**: Stores KYC data, preferences, and consent records.
   - **Ledger Service**: Double-entry accounting system managing balances and transactional integrity.
   - **Payments Service**: Interfaces with ACH, RTP, card processors, and crypto custody.
   - **Compliance Service**: KYC/AML screening, transaction monitoring, SAR workflows.
   - **Notifications Service**: Email/SMS/push with templates and rate limiting.
   - **Analytics Service**: Event ingestion, cohort analysis, risk scoring.
   - **Card Service**: Manages card issuance, tokenization, controls, and transaction webhooks.

4. **Data & Storage**
   - PostgreSQL for relational data (users, accounts, KYC, card settings).
   - Event store (Kafka) for payment events, ledger postings, and audit logs.
   - Redis for caching session tokens, rate limits, and idempotency keys.
   - S3-compatible storage for documents (ID scans, statements) with encryption.
   - Snowflake/BigQuery for analytics and compliance reporting.

5. **Infrastructure & DevOps**
   - Kubernetes (EKS/GKE) with service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) for traffic management and observability.
   - Terraform for IaC, GitHub Actions/CircleCI for CI/CD.
   - Secrets management via HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
   - Observability stack: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, ELK.

## Payment Rail Integrations

| Rail | Provider Options | Use Cases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ACH | Dwolla, Stripe Treasury, Unit, Modern Treasury | Bank transfers, recurring payments |
| RTP/FedNow | The Clearing House partners, Volante, Finzly | Instant bank payouts |
| Card Processing | Stripe Issuing, Marqeta, Galileo | Card loads, Visa Direct payouts, card controls |
| Crypto Custody | Fireblocks, Anchorage, Copper | USDC/USDT custody, withdrawal orchestration |
| FX/Remittance | Currencycloud, Airwallex | Cross-border payouts |

## Compliance & Risk Stack

- Identity verification vendors (Alloy, Persona, Onfido) integrated via orchestration engine.
- Transaction monitoring (ComplyAdvantage, Sardine) with configurable risk rules.
- Case management tool for compliance analysts with evidence collection and SAR filing support.
- Ledger audit trail with immutable event sourcing and time-stamped approvals.

## Security Controls

- End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3, AES-256 at rest) with HSM-backed key management.
- Multi-factor authentication (SMS, authenticator apps, WebAuthn).
- Device fingerprinting and behavioral biometrics for anomaly detection.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with least privilege for internal tools.
- Regular penetration testing, bug bounty program, and automated dependency scanning.

## Scalability Considerations

- Stateless services behind auto-scaling groups to handle peak loads.
- Sharded ledger database or partitioning by account ID for high throughput.
- Async processing via message queues (Kafka, SQS) for heavy workflows (KYC, payouts).
- Feature flags and progressive delivery to roll out new capabilities safely.

## Deployment Environments

1. **Development** – Local Docker Compose + shared sandbox services.
2. **Staging** – Mirrors production topology with anonymized data for testing.
3. **Production** – Multi-region active-active clusters with disaster recovery and RPO < 5 minutes.

## Implementation Roadmap (Technical)

1. Establish core infrastructure (IaC, Kubernetes baseline, CI/CD pipeline).
2. Build identity & onboarding services with vendor integrations.
3. Implement ledger service, payment orchestration, and wallet APIs.
4. Launch mobile/web clients with essential wallet functionality.
5. Integrate card issuance and advanced funding/off-ramp rails.
6. Instrument analytics, risk models, and operations tooling.
7. Harden security, run compliance audits, and expand internationally.
