# Security & Compliance Strategy

## Regulatory Landscape

- **Money Transmission**: Obtain money transmitter licenses (MTLs) or partner with a regulated sponsor bank/Program Manager to operate nationwide in the U.S.
- **KYC/AML**: Comply with FinCEN requirements, Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and implement risk-based customer due diligence.
- **Payment Networks**: Adhere to NACHA (ACH), card network rules (Visa/Mastercard), and crypto regulatory guidelines (e.g., NYDFS BitLicense if applicable).
- **Data Privacy**: Align with GDPR, CCPA, GLBA, and maintain privacy policies with clear consent management.

## Compliance Program Components

1. **Governance**
   - Designate a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and AML Compliance Officer.
   - Establish policies: AML, OFAC, KYC, transaction monitoring, record retention, complaints handling.
   - Board oversight with quarterly reporting and risk assessments.

2. **Customer Due Diligence (CDD)**
   - Collect and verify name, DOB, address, SSN/EIN, and beneficial ownership for businesses.
   - Implement automated ID verification with manual review escalation.
   - Screen against OFAC, politically exposed persons (PEP), and adverse media lists.

3. **Transaction Monitoring**
   - Real-time rules-based engine with machine learning augmentations.
   - Alert scoring, analyst queueing, and case management with audit trails.
   - SAR/CTR filing automation with secure regulator transmission.

4. **Recordkeeping & Reporting**
   - Retain transaction and KYC records for at least five years.
   - Provide user access logs, consent history, and dispute documentation.
   - Generate regulatory reports (NACHA returns, chargebacks, crypto travel rule data).

5. **Training & Awareness**
   - Annual AML and security training for all employees.
   - Role-specific training for customer support, engineers, and compliance staff.
   - Incident response tabletop exercises and disaster recovery drills.

## Security Architecture

- **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 in transit; AES-256 or stronger for data at rest; envelope encryption for documents.
- **Key Management**: HSM-backed master keys, rotation policies, and dual control approvals.
- **Authentication**: Password hashing with Argon2id, MFA enforcement, device binding, WebAuthn support.
- **Authorization**: Attribute-based access control (ABAC) for microservices, RBAC for internal tools.
- **Secrets Handling**: Centralized vault, short-lived credentials, and secret rotation automation.
- **Secure Coding**: Threat modeling, secure SDLC, mandatory code reviews, SAST/DAST pipelines.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Automated dependency scanning, patching SLAs, penetration tests, bug bounty program.
- **Incident Response**: 24/7 on-call, runbooks, postmortems, and communication templates.

## Data Protection & Privacy

- Data minimization and purpose limitation across services.
- Privacy-by-design reviews for new features.
- Data subject rights handling (access, deletion, portability) via self-service portal.
- Tokenization of sensitive identifiers (PANs, account numbers) and PAN vault via PCI-compliant provider.

## Operational Controls

- Segregation of duties between engineering, compliance, and finance.
- Dual approvals for high-risk actions (large payouts, card issuance overrides).
- Activity logging with immutable storage and security information & event management (SIEM).
- Business continuity plan with RTO < 1 hour and RPO < 15 minutes.

## Audit & Certification Roadmap

| Timeline | Certification/Assessment | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0-6 months | SOC 2 Type I readiness | Establish controls and monitoring. |
| 6-12 months | SOC 2 Type II audit | Demonstrate operating effectiveness. |
| 6-12 months | PCI DSS SAQ-D (with partner) | Required for card data handling. |
| 12+ months | ISO 27001 | International credibility for security posture. |
| 12+ months | State MTL examinations | If operating own licenses. |

## Risk Management

- Enterprise risk register capturing operational, compliance, market, and technology risks.
- Quarterly risk committee reviews with mitigation plans.
- KRIs (Key Risk Indicators) for fraud rates, chargebacks, system uptime, data breaches.

## Third-Party Management

- Due diligence questionnaires, security assessments, and contract SLAs for vendors.
- Continuous monitoring of critical vendors (payment processors, KYC providers).
- Exit strategies and contingency plans for vendor failure.
